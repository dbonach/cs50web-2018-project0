        <h5>Random Courses</h5>
        <p>When I don't know where to find a specific technologies resources, this
          is the place where I go,
          <strong><a href="https://hackr.io/">hackr.io</a></strong>. You will find
          anything here, paid, free, bad and good quality stuff. Usually when
          I'm looking something in the site I open all courses that are free,
          excluding youtube videos and check them out. I think almost all of the
          courses that I shared here are referenced on hackr.io.
        </p>
        <p>There are two more websites that I would like to mention:</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h5><a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/">Interneting is hard</a></h5>
        <p>I am so grateful to the person that made this website, It covers all
          the main concepts about HTML and CSS. The chapters are easy to understand
          with nice illustration and examples to follow along. CS50 won't teach
          you how to make pretty pages, but internetingishard will help you.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h5><a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">Missing Semester</a></h5>
        <p>I found this site while reading something on reddit and I gave a
          chance to it, it's a class from MIT, they aim to teach tools that
          usually cs students don't learn in their courses, usually linux
          related stuff. I only finished their first, second and third
          lecture and I already implemented what they taught. I used shell
          scripting and vim in one pset of CS50, vim is difficult to grasp at
          the beginning but it's rewarding when you are able to use it.
