        <h5>Structured Courses</h5>
        <p>
          These are the other resources that I found during my journey, they're
          well maintained and structured.
          I went through two of them but didn't stick to none of them. I think
          the reason is that a saw a clearer path on CS50 and I felt that I was
          evolving more.

        <p>Here they are:</p>

        <h5><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a></h5>

        <p>This is an open source project focused on fullstack development with
          javascript amd ruby on rails. I'm still at the beginning of their
          Introductory path and what I can say about the course is that they
          link references from other websites with selected content. They won't
          re-do what is already done with nice quality. There are also projects,
          so it might be a good opportunity to build up a portfolio.

        <h5><a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science">OSSU - Open
            source Society University</a>
        </h5>

        <p>
          This is an interesting one! It's an open source community that build
          a curriculum for computer-science using only online courses and resources,
          such as courses from Edx and Coursera.
          They structured the curriculum following a guideline from the
          The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), I don't know who they are
          but it seems legit! In their README.md you can know more about them and
          the courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          They also have an
          <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/extras/courses.md">extra courses</a>
          section that is worth taking a look at!

        <h5><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/">FreeCodeCamp</a></h5>

        <p>They have a broad range of topics in their curriculum, mainly
          focusing on front end development. The courses consist of short
          explanatory texts with a code challenge at the end, usually it's easy
          to implement.
          I started their <strong> JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
          </strong> course, but I haven't finished yet.
        </p>

        <p>If you're trying to figure out a learning path and get motivated you
          should check out this post, <a

            Lessons from 7 self-taught coders who now work full time as software developers</a>,
          not everyone has the same background but it's pleasing to see that
          many people find their way into web development.
