        <h5>Welcome!</h5>
        <p>First of all, I'll explain what this is all about. Basically, this my
          implementation of a problem set from <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2018/">
            CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</a> [2018 version].
        </p>
        <p>In <a href="https://docs.cs50.net/ocw/web/projects/0/project0.html">
            Project 0</a> we have to implement a simple static webpage about
          anything we want. So I decided to build a page about resources that
          helped me and still helps me on my path to learn web development and
          programming in general, focusing only in <strong> FREE RESOURCES.</strong>

        <h5>Organization</h5>
        <p>I organized this website in for separate sessions, besides about, we have:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Harvard's CS50:</strong> I love their courses! I think they're the most
            well structured that I've met so far. They have a very famous
            introductory course on CS, a few on web development, one about artificial
            intelligence and more! Usually I spend a great deal of time in the psets but
            I learn tons in them! I recommend to anyone who is looking for
            something challenging and well organized.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Structured:</strong> In this section I share other well structured
            courses that have different approaches and different purposes.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Random:</strong> As the name suggest, here I share websites where you can find
            any kind of courses related to web development, with a great variety of quality and subjects.
          </li>
        </ul>
