Hi! This is my implementation of project 0 from [Harvard's CS50: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2018/), 2018 version.

This project aims to make us familiar with HTML, CSS and SCSS. These are the [requirements](https://docs.cs50.net/ocw/web/projects/0/project0.html).

We were told to choose any subject that we are interested in. I decided to make a page about the main free resources that have helped me in my path to learn programming and web development. I've tried to keep it simple and clear.
