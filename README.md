# [CS50 Web 2018 - Project 0](https://dbonach.github.io/cs50web-2018-project0/)

Hi! This is my implementation of project 0 from [Harvard's CS50: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2018/).

This project aims to make us familiar with HTML, CSS and SCSS. These are the [requirements](https://docs.cs50.net/ocw/web/projects/0/project0.html).

We were able to choose any subject that we are interested in. I decided to make a page about the main free resources that have helped me in my path to learn programming and web development. I've tried to keep it simple and clear.

If you know anything similar to CS50 courses, please let me know (:

Maybe there are some grammatical mistakes, if youâ€™d like, feel free to correct them and send a pull request. It would be helpful!

The project is hosted in github pages, so you can check it up [here](https://dbonach.github.io/cs50web-2018-project0/).

Note: You can open it on your smartphone, it has a responsible design.
